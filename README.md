# Trust_Health
A Trust-Based Multilayered Network for Scalable Healthcare Service Management

## Abstract
We study the intricate relationships within healthcare systems, focusing on interactions among
doctors, departments, and hospitals. Leveraging an evolutionary graph framework, the proposed model
emphasizes both intra-layer and inter-layer trust relationships to better understand and optimize healthcare
services. The trust-based network facilitates the identification of key healthcare entities by integrating their
social and professional interactions, culminating in a trust-based algorithm that quantifies the importance
of these entities. Validation with a real-world dataset reveals a strong correlation (0.91) between the
proposed trust measures and the ratings of hospitals and departments, though doctor ratings demonstrate
skewed distributions due to potential biases. By modeling these relationships and trust dynamics, the
framework supports scalable healthcare infrastructure, enabling effective patient referrals, personalized
recommendations, and enhanced decision-making pathways.
